# INATrace

Open-source blockchain-based track and trace system for an agricultural commodities (such as coffee) supply
chain run. It provides transparency and creation of trust through
digitalization of supply chains, connects every actor along the supply chain, assures quality and fair pricing.

Project is composed of 4 parts, coordinated from the [INATrace project hub](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace) (project-wide documentation and governance):

* [Frontend application](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-frontend)
* [Mobile app](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-mobile)
* [Java backend](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-backend)
* [Coffee network](https://github.com/agstack/inatrace-coffee-network)

# Frontend

The Angular web application: where cooperatives and their partners configure
products and value chains, record deliveries, processing and payments, and
manage farmers.

## Quick start

```bash
nvm use                   # Node 14, from .nvmrc
npm install
npm run generate-api      # generates the API client from the Java backend
npm run dev               # http://localhost:4200
```

`npm run generate-api` needs the backend running, and the dev server needs an
`environment.dev.ts`. Both are covered in
[docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).
